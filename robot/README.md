# 2018-robot-code:robot
Robot subproject for the 2018 robot.

## Subproject-specific tasks
These can either be run in the command line using `gradlew` or
in the tasks list for whatever IDE you're in.

- `deploy` - Deploys everything to the roboRIO.
- `shuffleboard` - As it says on the tin, opens the Shuffleboard Dash.
- `build` - Builds the project, but does not deploy. This is good
for seeing if everything has been properly configured.
