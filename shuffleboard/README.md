# 2018-robot-code:shuffleboard
Custom Shuffleboard subproject for the 2018 robot. This includes
the layout configuration for the shuffleboard.

## Subproject-specific tasks
These can either be run in the command line using `gradlew` or
in the tasks list for whatever IDE you're in.

- `jar` - Assembles and builds a working jarfile.
- `build` - Builds the project, but does not deploy. This is good
for seeing if everything has been properly configured.
