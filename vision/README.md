# 2018-robot-code:vision
Vision subproject. This is code to be deployed to a Raspberry Pi.

## Subproject-specific tasks
These can either be run in the command line using `gradlew` or
in the tasks list for whatever IDE you're in.

- `deploy` - Deploys the code to a rPi and runs it.
- `build` - Builds the project, but does not deploy. This is good
for seeing if everything has been properly configured.
